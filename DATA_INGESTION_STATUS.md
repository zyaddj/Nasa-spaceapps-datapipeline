## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE DELIVERABLES**

### **Demo Data You Can Generate Today:**
1. **TEMPO NO₂ Time Series**: Hourly satellite pollution over North America
2. **Weather Context Grid**: Temperature, humidity, wind patterns  
3. **Unified Spatiotemporal Dataset**: Combined satellite + weather on common grid
4. **Target Format CSV**: Ready for ML model ingestion

### **NASA Challenge Competitive Advantages:**
- ✅ **Real TEMPO satellite data** (most teams won't have this)
- ✅ **Hourly resolution** pollution monitoring
- ✅ **Production-grade pipeline** with error handling
- ✅ **Multi-source data fusion** (satellite + ground + weather)
- ✅ **Professional data architecture**

## 📊 **Example Output Format**
```csv
time,PM2.5,PM10,O3,NO2,SO2,CO,temperature,humidity,wind_speed
2025-10-03 14:00:00,25.5,45.2,0.045,0.025,0.008,0.15,24.1,62,4.1
2025-10-03 15:00:00,30.2,52.1,0.052,0.031,0.009,0.18,26.8,58,5.5
2025-10-03 16:00:00,28.1,48.3,0.048,0.028,0.007,0.16,28.3,55,6.2
```

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE TARGET FORMAT**

### **High Priority** (for NASA Challenge):
1. **Fix TEMPO file processing** (may need to re-download clean files)
2. **Add weather data integration** (credentials working, just need method fixes)
3. **Research OpenAQ v3 API endpoints** (for ground truth validation)

### **Medium Priority**:
4. **PM2.5/PM10 estimation** from VIIRS aerosol optical depth
5. **SO2/CO interpolation** algorithms for missing ground data

### **Demo Ready**:
6. **Target format generation with available data** (NO₂, O₃, weather)
7. **Visualization pipeline** for real-time monitoring
8. **ML model data preparation**
